Computes the wavelet spectrum (wavelet variance v. scale) of path over specified scales using the Mexican hat wavelet.  Note that the edge effects increase with scale, so Vcwt at larger scales become's increasingly biased towards nodes in the center of the patch.

Inputs: 
    Patch = partch of digital elevation model
scales = wavelet scales over which the Vcwt is computer
dx = grid spacing

Outputs:
    Vcwt = vector of wavelet variance computer at each scale
    frq = vector of frequences
    wave = vector of wavelengths
